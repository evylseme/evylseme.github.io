**Musical application**
During this assignment you will design and produce an application that allows the user to make music in a novel way.

**Minimum requirements**

+ Some form of animated graphics
+ User interaction to construct sound combinations
+ Sounds that are triggered in some way
+ Basic instructions included somehow

## Brainstorming

+ Do something with colors, inspired by Pocahontas “can you paint with all the colors of the wind”
+ Use 3D model helmet, get some weapons and start hitting it. With every different weapon it will make a different sound. 
+ Think less instrument and more musical: make 1 scene of a fairy tale and let the user define the story. 

## Fairy tale

Famous fairy tales are usually about a villain, a prince and a princess. I’d like that traditional feel, also because my 3D model is already in a similar theme. I want to go so far back to traditional fairy tales to say we have a Dragon and a knight fighting over a princess. But I decided to add a support character to make things more interesting. This way I have 2 characters who are offensive and 1 defensive. 
So let me clarify the idea here: 
What the user will see is a play where he/she is the director. User will get 3 options (as there are 3 characters), all he can do is click on the next option. In other words, the user decides the order in which a character gets to do something. BUT! Every choice comes with a consequence. This can end very bad or very good. It can lead to the dragon killing everyone, so beware.

### Story 

The story is fairly simple and standard. The knight is send to defeat the dragon to bring back the princess. The knight brings a paladin/priestess with healing abilities for support in the dangerous battle. 

### Characters

**Knight:** 
+ Mission: ready to safe the princess. 
+ Has no intention of talking
+ Offensive character, believes in fighting
+ Close combat with great sword

**Dragon:**
+ Mission: protect its property and home
+ In this world dragons cannot speak, but they are noble creatures still. 
+ Seen by the world as hostile. 
+ Offensive character, the ways of animals
+ Both close and long range combat with fire, claws and teeth.

**Support:**
+ Mission: Help the knight in his mission
+ Has all intention to use peaceful ways to retrieve the princess.
+ Defensive character, believes in keeping the peace.
+ Long range combat with magic

## Mapped storylines
**SPOILER ALERT**

The next images show the choices a user can make and what the result would be!!!

Now to make it easier on coding later I gathered all possible actions per character:

## Design

Since I’m working with old fashioned fairy tales and musicals, what better than to make the environment looking like a theatre. It’ll instantly show it’s about a story. Having a theatre with the red curtains and wooden stage, also means the décor will look like carton that is painted on. Other than that, the characters will be 3D, because what’s a theatre without actors.

## Tooling

Unity, this is a free tool, famous for building games. It will give me the opportunity to easily find assets like the characters and the environment which will save time and effort that is not necessary. It also helps that I am already familiar with the program and understand it’s capabilities.

<br>

Special research has been conducted to find out if it can publish the game on a website, which is possible: 
+ [Building with unity webplayer](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter-tutorial/building-game)
+ [Building with WebGL (recommended by Unity instead of unity webplayer)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-building.html?_ga=2.44681324.938216090.1510362172-1831751997.1510362172 )

Assets can be found for free at [Unity asset store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/) and [Free3d.com](https://free3d.com/)
