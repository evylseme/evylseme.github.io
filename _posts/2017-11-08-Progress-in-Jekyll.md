It is wednesday 7 pm and finally I feel like I am making good progress on this portfolio website! 

But let me tell you what I did to get to the point I am now! 
For the website I first looked for some options, because I do not want to go for Jekyll just because it is what the teacher uses. I found Middleman, which is the same idea as Jekyll but they promise more possibilities. And I love that idea! Less restrictions, more magic! 

I installed Middleman quickly coming to the conclusing I couldn't get it started because it kept throwing bugs whenever I tried to deploy it. It was frustrating and time was running out to find the solution. Because of the time limit I quickly reverted to Jekyll to get something started. 

Next step, I looked at other blog designs and found this:

I love the idea of having it slightly different from a normal looking blog. This website surely shows something special. And then it hit me! The original idea for my portfolio website is that I wanted it to represent me. So who better to show than one version of me (hence the background). I chose this image because when I see that image I feel a little more empowered, a little more confidence about myself. Not to mention the mask makes it more mysterious as well. So I changed the image to fit as a background (I want it there, but it should not be the main attraction). From there I made a design in photoshop and started to implement it:
