The assignment was to build a UI kit for financial app with the optional goal of building it for teenages. 

## Research

The first thing I did was find a detailed meaning on "what is an UI kit?" It's a matter of opening google images and see what shows up when you search "Ui kit":

From the looks of the various UI kit found on Google Images they are grouped and almost shaped to already fit a smartphone screen. It seems some have also examples of assembled screens to show the developer how this kit could possibly look. It is possible to put a lot of UI elements in my kit, however since this is for a financial app, it has been decided to only due those of importance.

**Noticeable**

One big noticeable thing about banking apps is they wear the colors of their logo (corporate identity). For this assignment I do not have the option due to lack of company. Therefor the colors will be based off money (green) and to keep contrast close to this color and yet bring a little extra the second color shall be yellow. 
The next noticeable thing is flat design. With a banking app you can chose to be fashion forward (to use gradients). However considering a banking app needs to be easily understood by many kinds of people. Being fashion forward could lead to confusion because certain things do not look like they once did. Therefore, my design stays with flat design.
But to keep the app a bit more on the youthful and unique side, the white background both apps have, shall be replaced with a dark one (nearing black).
As for the elements used in banking apps, they seem to not need many. No fancy charts have been found or calendars for example.

## Conclusion

**Elements**

The next list of elements seem of importance: 
+ Buttons
  -	Not pressed
  - Locked
+ Text
  - Bigger headers
  - Smaller headers
  - Different colored headers (colors stay within the chosen color range)
  - Normal text
  - Small text
  - Bold text
+ Login
+ Profile picture
+ Tabs
+ Switch
+ Radio buttons
+ Textbox
+ Drawer menu
+ Several icons (money, arrows, sandwich for drawer menu, etc.)
+ Lines
+ Bars

**Colors**

+ Green
+ Yellow
+ Grey/Black
+ White

**Design tool**

For this assignment Illustrator will be used, because this is the tool usually made for (example) icon building. From a professional point of view, may the UI kit ever be used, making the UI kit vector based makes sure it never loses it graphical quality. This makes sure the potential user of the UI kit can easily reuse elements in different sizes. If it were important the UI kit had detailed pictures, where pixel work is more important, then Photoshop could have been the better option. 

## Execution

The next image shows my work environment. When I work with adobe photoshop or illustrator I work a lot with guides, rulers, several layers (nicely named and grouped for a better overview). 

However this is the first time I truly use Illustrator for something a bit more complicated than I would usually do. I can say I gained proper experience to use Illustator and start to see the true value. And like I said before I use guidlines when I can. However I noticed they work different in Illustator in comparison to Photoshop, so it was a small struggle to figure out how to use them well. Same thing for layers. I found a way to group them nicely. I devoted a bit of time to focus on getting an organised workspace.
