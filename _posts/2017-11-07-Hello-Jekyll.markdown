Hello Jekyll! This is the first time I'm using you. I chose you because the internet promised me you are dummy proof (-ish) and I do not have a lot of experience with building websites. 

If I had more time, I actually would've gone for Middleman. This is a similar static website generator as Jekyll, however they promise Middleman is more open. You are less restricted and capable of more. But as there is not a lot of time to have that big amount of freedom, as well as the installation is supposably more time consuming. My time is severely limited. 

Okay! Wish me luck!
Keep you posted~
