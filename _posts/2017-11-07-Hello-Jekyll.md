Hello Jekyll~. Nice to meet you! 
This is the first time I'm using you. I chose you because the internet promised me you are dummy proof (-ish) and I do not have a lot of experience with building websites. 

<br>

If I had more time, I actually would've gone for Middleman. This is a similar static website generator as Jekyll, however they promise Middleman is more open. You are less restricted and capable of more. But as there is not a lot of time to have that big amount of freedom, as well as the installation is supposably more time consuming. My time is severely limited. 

<br>

Okay! Wish me luck!
Keep you posted~
