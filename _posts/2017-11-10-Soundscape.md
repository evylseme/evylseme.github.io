The assignment is about making a soundscape inspired by the following image:

## Research

To execute this assignment I wish to build a soundscape which creates a scene in the area which the former image describes. 

The image is set in the time of pirates, swords, horses and carriages, drunk/singing people, etc. The scene is taking place in a harbor where there are people, music, animals and of course the ocean with seagulls. 

**Story**

This figure is a sketch to get an idea of what the soundscape is going to sound like. There are 3 points of interest, on the ship, walking past the tavern and last the market place. 

**Tool**

During this assignment the tool Audacity shall be used, because itâ€™s easy to understand with plenty of functions. Also, I have previous experience with this tool. 

## Execution

Through Google I landed on the website FreeSound.org. This website has heaps of sounds free for downloading and this is where I got all sounds, but 1. The music coming from the tavern, I decided to go with the song Two Hornpipes (Tortuga) from Pirates of the Carribbean. 

## Result

//TODO: enter soundscape here
