Pfff... I have to say, even if the interactivity product is... bad. I feel like I did everything I could in the time that I had. I worked for school in the last weeks 12 to 14 hours a day (including weekends). And for the first time I do not feel like "i should've start earlier". I truly feel like I gave it my all. So, I am very happy with the result of my hard work, my perfectionistic side is crying in a little corner that the results are not as expected. 

I noticed I lack still bits and pieces of knowledge to get things to be perfect. And I wish I understood Java/JavaScript better so I could actually build the musical thing (maybe!) better. Instead of using Unity. But the posts will explain how much I did. I hope all is understandable (English is till not my first language). 

If I had to do this again I don't think I would do much different, rather than now being able to plan everything better. 

If I got a change to keep perfecting this portfolio and its items, the next things I would do: 
+ fix the fonts (make sure it works on all/most browsers and OS systems)
+ try to make the interactive part in Adobe Animate, but maybe research if anything I want is available. 
+ I would fixed the bottom of the portfolio (it seems to want to stick to the bottom of the screensize, not the browser window size. I temporary fixed it with added an extra break at the end.)
+ I would add a list of tags/categories on the left side of the website. 
+ I would make in the project posts a navigation block with all the headers on the left side (because some posts are quite long and then it's better to see what is included anyway)
+ I would add another color to the portfolio. Now it's based around 2 colors mostly, green and white/yellow ish. And with that extra color I can make hovering over the links better visable.
+ I would try to add animations to the portfolio. I wish the portfolio would go from one page to another in a smooth way. 
+ I want to make the portfolio an actual website I can present to companies as well (e.g. include CV). 

(And I could add perfecting the products like the video or put the 3d model in the way I actually wished it, but than the list would be endless.)

So as you can see, there is still a lot I actually want! But the start is here! If I get the chance I think I might actually try and finish this.
