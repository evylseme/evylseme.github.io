For this assignment a short lifehack video has to be developed. 

## Research 

Google tells me this is the definiation of lifehack:

A strategy or technique adopted in order to manage one's time and daily activities in a more efficient way.

<br>

YouTube has heaps of lifehack videos! I've noticed you don't see any people, just hands building something to solve problem the easy/cheap way. Others tell entire stories during their lifehack. Welcome word, what is the problem, showing the solution and "Don't forget to subscribe"-farewell.

Example: [Youtube lifehack style of my liking](	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVmsiskjPgI)

## Ideas

So, mainly I wanted to hold my video about something being a student from the Netherlands studying abroad for half a year in New Zealand. That way I can also help some other temporary kiwi-noob be a bit better prepared. 

+ Leaving in summer, arriving in winter
  - Problems: cold houses, Cold weather, Different weather (4 seasons on a day)
  - Solution: rubber water sack (in bed), weedbag, thermoclothing, layered clothing, (electric blanket), spend time at school more than at home.
+ Packing for half a year gone
  - Problem: what to take? Not too much, not too less
  - Solution: buying stuff in NZ: trademe, facebook, people.
+ Packing light for a long hike
  - Problem: what to take? Not too much, not too less
  - Solution: (not thought of yet)
+ Plan for your journey (holiday)  
  - Problem: no clue where to go, for how long, etc. 
  - Solution: google maps/directions and google stuff to do 
+ Everything breaks!
  - Problem: all things break in this country, clothing with holes, broken equipment
  - Solution: ducktape, sewing, warning: take care of stuff, be prepared for these things.

I like the idea of 'summer going winter' best, because it was most remarkable to me when I got on the plane. 

## Tool

The tool for video editing I'll be using is Da Vinci Resolve. I tried it out during a previous edited video and I find it comfortable to work with. It is not too difficult and can deliver more than Windows Movie Maker. Not to mention Da Vinci Resolve has been praised on the internet for being easier to use than the professional tool Sony Vegas Pro. Vegas I tried a few years ago and had a difficult time with it.

## Script and storyboard

So I just wrote down what I "could" say during the video. It means, I am allowing myself to go off script if I'm in the flow anyway. 

<br>

**part one: introduction**

+ Hello fellow humans! I want you to close your eyes for a moment and think about those cold winter. Tell me, where are you in that moment? Are you outside freezing? Or are you inside, by the fire or heater, or even in your nice warm bed. That’s what you expect of your home right? A place of warmth. 
+ I’m a student from the Netherlands and I studied abroad in New Zealand from July till November. When I got on the plane we just experienced a heatwave. When I got off, it was nearing the 0 degrees. That is a huge difference going from summer to winter! 
+ Now here’s the issue. I expected at the very least when I got home it would be nice and warm inside… I was wrong.

**part two: problem**

+ If you are ready to travel to NZ, going from Summer to winter as I did. You know to bring winter clothing. Good! It’s a start, but it won’t make the house you are most likely staying in any warmer. If you want to survive in winter time in NZ, there are a few ways that are also energy saving.

**part three: solution**

+ One! Get a heater and/or electric blanket. It is not energy saving, but it is handy. Check with your flatmates if there is a free hour arranged and make sure you use that hour well! For your safety, don’t sleep with the electric blanket on all night. 
+ Two! Rubber hot water bottles and weedbags! 2 hot waterbottles are enough, one for the top part of your body and one for your legs. Watch out though! Don’t get burned while sleeping! Wrap it in a towel or buy a cover, or just sleep carefully next to them. Use a weedbag if you want to hold onto warm. And do not forget to be extra careful with water and electric blankets. 
+ Three! Thermo clothing, very handy! Keep your natural body heat in and most of the cold out.
+ Four! Spend your time elsewhere! I spend most of my time at school. This way, you don’t have to pay for electricity, or keep yourself busy in the gym for example.

**part 4: outro**

+ And that is it! 
+ I hope you are prepared now if you are planning to go!
+ Good luck and have fun!

## Execution

Okay! So first things first, shooting the scenes. Since I didn't have a tripot for my phone at my disposal I used the camera and microphone of my laptop. It's not the best quality, but it did the job. I shot the entire video at once, multiple times. This way I hope that I have enough footage that I captures good moments and bad (and cut out the bad during post-production phase).

And when I was done shooting I made the pictures I am planning to show of the items I'm talking about in the video. 

And so everything is gathered and I can get to work!

As it turns out, windows saved the files in .mp4 files, but DaVinci can not handle these files. All I had was a muted video now! After some research I decided to take the audio from the .mp4 files with windows movie maker. Then I could take out some of the noise with Audacity. I have to say after working with the sound and with the video, I noticed that my laptop has terrible quality (both sound and video). But I worked with it eitherway and here is the result!

## Result

So I wish I had done this with better quality sound and video. Also, after reviewing the end result it might seem kind of rushed, so if I got a second chance I would retake a few shots to get more time inbetween the shots in the resulting video.
