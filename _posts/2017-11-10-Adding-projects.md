Today I worked in Jekyll on fixing bugs and getting my first projects online! And look! I also have a github link to my github account. 

Mostly, I learned today about posts. I use Jekyll-now to create this website and it has been very helpful to get it up and running. Especially because something are already build in and all I have to do is some minor changes in the styling. 

<br>
For example. Yesterday I couldn't get link in markdown files to be just that, links. I also had to figure out a way to get proper headers and spacing between paragraphes. Another problem was getting the image to automatically scale to the size of the block, and how to get bullet points to display nicely. 
Most of this I could easily solve thanks to Jekyll-now. I understand now that the number of hashtags represents the header+number like h1 or h3. In the .scss file you then can make sure that all h2 or h3 (whatever you wish) has a certain look. Just have a look at this easy to understand [github page](https://gist.github.com/roachhd/779fa77e9b90fe945b0c)
And the rescaling of the image turned out to be truly easy as well! By using the given name between the [] in the .scss file.

So today I managed to add: 
+ about page
+ UI kit
+ Soundscape (without the result yet)
+ 3d model (just the intro, research and design. Execution and result have yet to come)
+ linking the posts to the correct navigation item.
+ favicon (just for fun. The fleur de lis represent something personal, it is between my best friend and I.)
