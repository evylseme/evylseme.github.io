The assignment is to make a 3D model in Sketch, Blender or another 3D drawing tool. 

**Special request**

For this assignment a helmet will be designed fitting to the rest of my 2018 costume design. In order to design the helmet accordingly, the entire outfit shall be analyzed. 

## Cosplay

Cosplay is short of Costume Player. A cosplayer is a person who dresses up as for example their favorite TV, game or anime character. They can usually be found on conventions and events such as the famous Comic Con’s from America and Armageddon in New Zealand. They can enter contests on convention or events like the biggest costume event in Europe called Elfia (from the Netherlands), it is possible to get free photoshoots in the special selected locations.

### Co-oplay

As a cosplayer you can buy an outfit, have one made for you or make one yourself. My best friend and I chose to become a team called Co-oplay. Since the beginning we work with “based off” costumes rather than look-a-like. This means we decide a theme or a character and turn that existing outfit into something that matches our body type, available materials, weather and likings.

## Research

### Team effort

The upcoming costume will be built to match a larger cosplay team. Therefore, a few team characteristics are required: 

+ Chose a design from the game Elder Scrolls Online or use Dungeons and Dragons as inspiration. 
+ Team color is red. 
+ Team symbol/mascot is a Dragon. 

### My own requirements

I shall be the warrior of the team. This means I have to design a full body armor. However since wearing foam is extremely warm in summer as well as Worbla (thermoplastic) being expensive it will be tuned down a bit. 

The colors are mainly (dark) red, silver and black; and the entire outfit shall have elements dragon style like the use of scales and spikes. 

My main inspiration armor shall be from the game Elder Scrolls Online collection:

The overall outfit has elements which need to be removed/changed to fit the dragon theme I’m looking for, it is missing elements like scales and it has too often the dragon symbol showing up (chest piece has 4 and the arm and leg bracers also have them) as well as the symbol in the middle of the skirt is unclear what it represents.

### Separate the parts

#### Boots

A dragon has scales all over its body, that includes the legs. Therefore, it is preferred to use scales here, big and small. The knee caps however will be designed slightly different to break the scaled pattern. I do not wish to turn this entire outfit into a dragon, but rather an armor that represents a dragon. Knee caps on most ESO armors seem pattern breaking with the idea to stay with the familiar safety knee caps from daily life. 

#### Skirt/pants

The underpants shall be simple, black and fabrics that can breathe so it stays cool. The skirt exists out of 4 parts: 2 side parts which will be very similar to the Ebonheart armor. They are simple of design and shall keep the outfit from becoming too detailed. The front and the bag part is what will be in the picture. Therefore, what I wish to display needs to be understood. The Ebonheart has a drawing on the front skirt part which is not to my liking because it does not make clear what it is representing. Instead, this will be reimagined by another front from another ESO armor:

This front has more potential into representing a tail. During designing I must not forget the ability to sit and move (this also counts for the other parts).

#### Chest armor

It’s important for the chest plate to work to my body type as well as it is easy to get on and off. I find it important that the dragon logo at the front stays, because it makes very clear for what team I play. The back of the chest armor will not have the dragons, because I feel symbols shouldn’t be repeated too often. Instead of dragon symbols, dragon spikes (kept to a minimum because of the ability to sit) shall replace them.

#### Shoulder

Overall the shoulder armor is to my liking, however the issue here might be the difficulty level when building it. This is the only armor piece which shall be excluded in this research, because it requires prototyping, fitting and matching.

#### Arm armor / gloves

A dragons arms and claws are another great feature. Therefore, these armor parts shall be replaced with a design with mainly scales. Also to keep the heat to a minimum the gloves will only go over the knuckles. This means I must sacrifices the claw look. 

#### Helmet

The helmet shall be replaced entirely because I personally do not like the look of it. Instead research has been conducted on other ESO helmets, dragon head and helmets made by other cosplayers. To stay within the game a helmet called the Daedric helmet was found (picture on the left). This helmet has similar horns to most dragons.

## Designing

#### Boots

The way of the scales are mixed with the dragon is organically matching. This means, in the design the scales follow the way the leg moves. E.g. the bigger scales in the middle move from big to small because a leg has a similar shape. Only slight hard corners for the tip of the scales are used because that’s how a scale is designed, all other lines are organically placed. The knee cap protection is designed with a simple 3 layered bigger scale which is can be used for the helmet and shoulder armor, and is similar to the skirt sides.

#### Skirt

The skirt part is based off the Ebonheart armor. Some details were removed because they didn’t fit the overall design. The middle part has been changed into 3 flaps with similar fire design as the chest piece displays. The belt has been simplified.

#### Chest

The pictures below show the completely developed chest plate. Most of the original Ebonheart design was kept.

#### Arm bracers / gloves

The upper arm bracer is simply existing from a few rows of big scales. There won’t be anything special about this bracer because it is mostly to hide under the shoulder armor. 
The lower arm bracer has a similar design to the boots. And the gloves are for the knuckle part only, because this way you are prepared for fake battle as well as not having to wear too hot gloves in summer time.

#### Helmet

We'll look deeper into the design of the helmet. From previous parts there are a few elements that are returning: 
+ Scales (large and small) 
+ Squares
+ (silver) lining

A dragons head however looks special. Most dragons have large horns and the scales on the nose line are some times special just like displayed in the image below.

I combined both the inspiration from the dragon with the example helmets shown before and designed this:

## Tool

In order to build this 3D model, I’ve chosen to work with Blender, because it works with the functions I require. It’s a professional familiar environment with ways to not just make a 3D design, but also color it. This way I can fully check my design and change it till it is good enough. 

## Execution

So, I know I said I'm familiar with Blender, but I have not yet done a project complicated like a helmet with hornes and what not! So when I started I restarted a few times because I screwed up (by using Blender wrong and any fix made it worse). In the end, I slowly learned thanks to the help of YouTube tutorials how to use the odd hotkeys, how to cute parts, add parts, etc.

You know, I learned that my perfectionism is not very good for such projects. I will want it to be all neat and in the end not being able to find a solution on how to do that! So for now, I'll leave the smoothness be, and try out matherials.

A color is pretty easy to add. If there is time left I will try more with textures. 

## Result

I found a way to display 3d models:

However I do not have enough javascript knowledge to make it work (for now). 

So for now, i'm displaying in images.

I left this version white, so you can see the details which have been modeled better. I had quite a bit of trouble with getting the scales to my satisfaction, so I asked one of my friends from the Netherlands to help me out there. 

So, I played around with texture, but never got the correct colors on the right places. It seems I still have a lot to learn there. The plan was to make the front scales silver, hornes either black or dirty ivory, the remainder the same dark red as my chest piece displays and some silver lining at the bottom of the scales on the back and if it looks like also around the eyes and cheeks parts.
