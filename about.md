## Hi there! 

I am a happy IT'er named Eveline. And I like to share with you my passion for creativity. It's not just a creativity in designing and I'm also not claiming I have a talent for creativity. No, I just simply love it! From the start till the end it is going to be a big part of my life. I use it for times like these, when I build my portfolio with (in this case) assignments from school or in my life as an IT'er with a specialization in embedded systems, as well as in my private life as a cosplayer! (If you do not know what it is, click [here]({% post_url 2017-11-10-3D-model%}) for more information.) 

Hope you enjoy my website and have a nice day!

### More Information

Oh hey! You are still reading~, hehe. Well, there is more to me than just IT, creativity and cosplay. 

<br>

I grew up in the Netherlands. A tiny country in Europe trying to stay dry from all the rain (not to mention from the ocean as it lays lower than ocean level XD). Specifically I'm from Limburg, a province at the bottom of this small country, where every tiny village to every big city has their own dialect. It's quite funny to hear! 

<br>

While I currently study at Fontys Hogeschool ICT & Technology (aka a university for IT with specialization in embedded systems and PCL's.) It basically means I get to play with robots like the Nao or developer boards like the famous Arduino and Raspberry Pi. And that is just the tip of the iceberg from what we do at Fontys. At this very moment I am in my Minor semester and I chose to do my minor abroad in New Zealand. What a fantastic time! I learned so much during the lectures and about the people and land as well. If you get the chance I recommend to go and study in another country, it is the experience of a lifetime! Well... for me it was, haha. 

<br>

So that was a bit about my past. I wish I knew where my future was heading, but I have dreams. They are not very big. I don't wish to become a leader or head of a company. I just wish to play around with physical technology. I wish to one day build perhaps more [Cozmo's](https://www.anki.com/en-gb/cozmo) and possible ironman suits. Come on, who wouldn't want a little Wall-e running around their living room!
